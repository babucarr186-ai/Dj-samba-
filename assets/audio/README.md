# Adding your MP3 previews

Drop your short preview MP3s in this folder using these exact filenames:

- afrobeats.mp3
- amapiano.mp3
- hiphop.mp3
- latin.mp3

Notes:
- Keep them short (10–30s) for fast loading.
- We recommend 128–192 kbps, stereo.
- The site attempts to load these first; if they’re missing, it auto-generates a small WAV loop as a fallback so the players always work.
- You can replace tracks anytime; refresh the page to see updates.
