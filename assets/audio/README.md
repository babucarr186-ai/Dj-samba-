# Adding your audio previews (MP3/OGG)

Drop your short preview files in this folder using these exact filenames:

- afrobeats.mp3 (optional: afrobeats.ogg)
- amapiano.mp3 (optional: amapiano.ogg)
- hiphop.mp3 (optional: hiphop.ogg)
- latin.mp3 (optional: latin.ogg)

Notes:
- Keep them short (10–30s) for fast loading.
- Recommended: 128–192 kbps, stereo. OGG can sound better at lower bitrates if you prefer.
- The site loads OGG if present, then falls back to MP3; if neither exists, it auto-generates a small WAV loop so players always work.
- You can replace tracks anytime; refresh the page to see updates.
